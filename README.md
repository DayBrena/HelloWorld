Greetings!

My name is Daylin and I'm enchanted to meet you!

My hope is to be a thriving woman who codes. I'm eager to 
learn various languages such as JavaScript, HTML, Python and more!
The factors which attract me most to coding include the freedom it 
promotes for mobility, creativty and innovation in an ever changing world.
